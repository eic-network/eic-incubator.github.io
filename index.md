  Our primary purpose is the joint reporting and publication of investigative journalism with a focus on European topics to understand how power structures affect European communities.

  #### Cooperation

  The basis for cooperation among EIC member organizations is the regular sharing of information and consultations on possible story ideas. We have regular meetings and work on several fronts: tackling European stories; finding, compiling, processing or analyzing big data-sets; developing under Free Software license our own Network collaborative tools, platforms und information design.

  We take a long-term approach and therefore involve in our collaborative projects the generation #25 to work together with senior reporters and editors.

  #### Membership

  This is a non-exclusive Network, meaning that members can be part of other Networks, but only one medium or media outlet from each European country can be an EIC member, ensuring national exclusivity.

  #### Coordination

  Stefan Candea is coordinating the Network communication, workflow and tools development. Each investigative collaboration will have him working closely with the story initiator to decide on the work plan, tools and publication schedule.

  Here are our governing principles:

  *   In a healthy network all nodes (participants) should profit from the network;
  *   Keep the network alive, open to fresh ideas and people following new suggestions on partnerships;
  *   In order to achieve a healthy growth, better network density and kick-starting the whole process, we will act as a laboratory for networked (investigative) journalism;
  *   We start with basic research projects that would also be used to establish networking tools and collaborative platforms;
  *   Decentralize the network's decision making process on new stories, new partners, new projects;
  *   Understand and follow a set of predefined routines for each new project.

  We believe networks are here to stay. Due to their structure and methodology, collaborative networks are one of the few mechanisms able to keep up with the globalized power structures (ie. governments, corporations), thus becoming the only way forward for investigative journalism.

  EIC is putting together different mind-sets, organization types and skills. This is insuring a flow of new challenges, ideas and approaches. Our aim is to build a European network to focus on independent, high-quality cross-border and European investigative journalism projects.

  Our focus areas: (un)organized crime, environment, sport, public spending, corporate corruption, lobby, public health, religious groups, state aid, military & secret services, banks & finance, labor markets, migration.
problems: |-
  - Resources for network investigations are centralized and controlled by intermediaries outside of the actual newsrooms.
  - While there are some initiatives out there, no investigative network brings intentional focus to the biggest topic today: climate collapse and how it impacts our society.
  - Collaborative intestigative tech infrastructures are expensive and struggling to keep up with the current independence and security challenges as well as with the growing colume of news leaks
solution: |-
  - Creating a direct gateway to a pool of investigative skills from the inside and outside of the news world, powered by a uniwue partnership between a dozen European leading newsrooms.
  - Leveraging our thematic experience in investigating Offshore and Organized Crime, and spin it towards other thematic topics, by bridging existing academic research with journalistic techniques.
  - Cutting costs by combining across borders the newsrooms investigative skills & amrketing power & audience impact. Develop and maintain independent cutting edge technology to facilitate investigative collaborations
value: |-
  The EIC Incubator is a One-Stop-Shop for turnkey investigative collaborations with a focus on climate collapse, society and beyond, bridging news and academia, for the public interest.
beneficiaries: |-
  - Citizens, the broad public
  - The EIC Incubator research and publication partners
  - The EIC network
