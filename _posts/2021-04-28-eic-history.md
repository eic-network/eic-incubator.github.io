  EIC partners are pulling together resources to do investigative research but also to develop tools and information design. We are building tools under a Free Software Licence and the lead developer is DER SPIEGEL IT department, but all EIC member organizations commit themselves to contribute.

  During the coming months EIC will decide on future partnerships related to stories or tools development.
