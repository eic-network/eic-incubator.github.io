By [EIC.network](https://eic.network/blog/malta-registry-of-companies-and-scraper-published)

After finishing the publication of almost 100 stories under the [Malta Files](https://eic.network/projects/malta-files) project, EIC.network has released in public the part of the data used for this research originating from the public [Malta Registry of Companies](http://rocsupport.mfsa.com.mt/pages/SearchCompanyInformation.aspx). We have re-arranged, cleaned and made searchable in new ways the public information contained in the register.

Here you can find the latest outupt of the scrap of the Malta Registry, as of [mid June 2017](https://github.com/eic-network/malta-files). Also here you find different search tools published by partners [Le Soir](http://data.lesoir.be/maltafiles/index.html) and [El Mundo](http://www.elmundo.es/economia/malta-files/2017/06/10/593b3724e5fdea5d248b462b.html).

If you want to use our scraper yourself, go ahead, you should [find everything you need here](https://github.com/eic-network/malta-roc-scraper).
