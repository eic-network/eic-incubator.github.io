title: Black Trail
intro: How to kill the planet and get away with it. An investigation into shipping
  emissions.
description: "Black Trail is an agenda-setting investigation into the environmental
  impacts of the shipping industry — a sector that is all but untouchable as it receives
  eye-watering subsidies and stashes its profits in tax havens, all the while polluting
  with impunity.\n\nThis collaboration initiated by EIC brings together journalists
  from newsrooms and TV networks across Europe, including Expresso and SIC TV (Portugal),
  The Black Sea (Eastern Europe), Reporters United (Greece), VG (Norway) and RTS (Switzerland),
  with research and reporting support from Financed Uncovered (UK).  \n\nThe cross-border
  team focuses on how the shipping industry has “captured” the International Maritime
  Organization, the UN agency that has, since 1948, been the only body charged with
  regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants produced by ships.\n\nAlthough
  the shipping industry insists that it carries 90 percent of global freight yet is
  responsible for less than three percent of carbon dioxide emissions, the investigation
  exposes a darker — and deadlier — reality.\n\nIt shows how the sector has dodged
  the climate debate as it continues to burn the dirtiest of all transport fuels.
  Ship emissions are responsible for more than 50,000 deaths a year in Europe as particles
  like black carbon drive up cancer rates in Mediterranean port cities.\n\nMeanwhile,
  the same emissions are contributing to climate change as they speed up the melting
  of Arctic icecaps."
