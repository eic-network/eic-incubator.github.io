title: Diamville
intro: A deep dive into how Wagner mercenaries are taking over the diamonds of Central
  African Republic.
description: "After we exposed [Bois Ruge](https://eic.network/projects/bois-rouge.html)
  as a vehicle of the Wagner group grabbing the exotic timber of CAR in exchange of
  mercenaries, we looked closer at a company established in the same day: Diamville.
  \n\nThe research has unraveled a unique construct that overlaps Wagner military,
  Prigozhin commercial operations, diamond mining, looting and exporting - all in
  the shadows of a single entity. Investigating DiamVille reveals how Russian mercenaries
  are looting & exporting Centrafrican diamonds to Europe via Belgium, while marketing
  per Facebook to a global clientele. \n\nThe investigation was done in collaboration
  with with [All Eyes on Wagner](https://alleyesonwagner.org/) and [The Dossier Center](https://dossier.center/)."
